            <li>Line a baking sheet with parchment paper.</li>
            <li>Gently pat salmon fillets dry with paper towels. Place on the baking sheet, skin side down.</li>
            <li>Use a butter knife or spoon to gently spread an equal amount of the softened butter over the top of each salmon fillet.</li>
            <li>Sprinkle the top of the salmon with the salt and black pepper.</li>
            <li>Finely mince the garlic.</li>
            <li>Remove and discard the rosemary stems. Finely mince the leaves.</li>
            <li>Distribute the minced garlic and rosemary evenly over the tops of the salmon fillets.</li>
            <li>Bake the salmon on middle rack of oven until it flakes easily with a fork, 12-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Check to see that salmon is done. Remove from oven or add time as needed.</li>
            <li>Squeeze fresh lemon juice over salmon if desired. Serve immediately. Refrigerate leftovers in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</li>
